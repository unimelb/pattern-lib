## Tabs with Select

You can modify the tabs to use a select dropdown instead of tabs by setting the `use-select` prop.

The following optional props are only usable with `use-select`:

- `title` (title to show to the left of the select)
- `label` (set label of 'bubble' above select)
- `show-count` (counts tabs and displays accumulated count)
