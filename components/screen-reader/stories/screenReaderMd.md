## Example

- Use the keyboard navigation (TAB) to see the screen reader only component.

> Screen readers will be able to skip to the main content instead of going and tabbing through the Mega Menu.

```html
<screen-reader button-text="Choose the text of the skip button" button-href="Choose where you wanna the button linked to eg: #main"></screen-reader>
```
