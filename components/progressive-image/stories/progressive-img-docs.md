Use this component to progressively load a large image, optionally showing a small, blurred placeholder image while the full-size image is loading. The placeholder should be an extremely small version of the image.

This component uses a default height/width ratio of 64% when displaying the placeholder. You can disable or customise this behaviour with attributes `no-ratio` and `aspect-ratio` respectively. For more information, please refer to the [component's official documentation](https://github.com/MatteoGabriele/vue-progressive-image)
