## Breadcrumbs

The level of the `breadcrumbs` is decided by the array `items` that you send as a prop to the component.

- Example of the extra long:

```
items: [
      { href: "/", text: "About us" },
      { href: "/strategy", text: "Strategy and governance" },
      { href: "/strategy/growing-esteem", text: "Growing Esteem" },
      {
        href: "/strategy/growing-esteem/learning-and-teaching",
        text: "Learning and teaching"
      },
      {
        href:
          "/strategy/growing-esteem/learning-and-teaching/key-facts-and-figures",
        text: "Key facts and figures"
      }
    ]
```
