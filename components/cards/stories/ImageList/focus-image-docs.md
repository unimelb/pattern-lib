For the progressive image loader to work with this component, use the custom component `<progressive-background src="http://sourceimage.url">`. If you are able to generate a smaller image to use as placeholder you can pass it using the `placeholder` attribute -- cf. _Progressive Images / Background image loader_ for details. By default the image height will be limited to 240px. Add class `.card__thumb--full` to the `progressive-background` component to expand to the height of the image.
