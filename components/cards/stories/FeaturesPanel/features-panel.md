## Features panel

### How this works

A features (and/or benefits) panel displays between 2 and 3 (preferably 3) main feature/benefit areas to help drive home key selling points. Optional CTA buttons should be available for each.

### Dos and don'ts

- 2 or 3 columns only
- Optional CTAs for each column
- If CTAs are in use, they should be for all columns
- Copy needs to be balanced/consistent across the row
- Feature panels should be limited to a single row (except on Mobile, where items will need to flow vertically).
