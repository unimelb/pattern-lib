## Example

- Use the keyboard navigation (TAB) to see the screen reader only component.

> Screen readers will be able to skip to the main content instead of going and tabbing through the Mega Menu.

```html
<screen-reader-jump-to text="Choose the text of the skip button" to-element="main"></screen-reader-jump-to>
```

`to-element` property is optional, by default this component is looking for the element by the "main" role. You should add a `role="main"` attribute to the main content:
```html
<div role="main">
  Content
</div>
```
