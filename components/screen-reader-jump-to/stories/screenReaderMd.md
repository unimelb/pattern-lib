## Example

- Use the keyboard navigation (TAB) to see the screen reader only component.

> Screen readers will be able to skip to the main content instead of going and tabbing through the Mega Menu.

```html
<screen-reader-jump-to text="Choose the text of the skip button" to-element="#main"></screen-reader-jump-to>
```

`to-element` property is optional, by default this component is looking for the element by the "#main".
