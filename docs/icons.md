# Icons

## How to add an icon to the repo

1.  Make sure that the icon's SVG document is square and that the icon itself is centred within that document. The icon should meet the edges of the document in at least one direction (i.e. horizontally or vertically). The dimensions of the document don't really matter, but small numbers can lead to a smaller file size.
2. Export the icon as "optimised SVG" (the term used in Inkscape), making sure to enable viewboxing (i.e. it should end up with a`viewBox` attribute).
3. Optimise the icon further with SVGO: https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ and remove any `fill` attribute.
4. Place the icon at the root of the `components/icons` folder and give it a meaningful, hyphenated name - e.g. `chevron-right`.
5. If needed, add the icon to the sprite as a `symbol`.


## How to use icons in the codebase

### In CSS

Because CMS editors can't add SVG code inside WYSIWYG blocks, some icons should be declared as CSS background images (e.g. chevron icon in buttons).

```css
/* USAGE */
background-image: url('~icons/chevron-right.svg?fill=#fff');

/* OUTPUT */
background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='7 3 14 14'%3E %3Cpath d='m8,7.42l4.58,4.58l-4.58,4.59l1.41,1.41l6,-6l-6,-6l-1.41,1.42z' fill='%23f00' /%3E %3C/svg%3E")
```

Sizing and positioning `background-image` icons is a bit complex but manageable. Here is a typical example:

```css
&::after {
  content: '';
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: -.05em; /* magic number for vertical centring (relative to `baseline`) */
  width: .75em; /* relative to font-size */
  height: .75em; /* square like the icon */
  background-image: url('~icons/chevron-right.svg?fill=#000');
  background-size: cover; /* scale icon to fit */
}
```

#### Under the hood

The webpack configuration includes the following loaders:

- [svg-url-loader](https://github.com/bhovhannes/svg-url-loader) converts the icons to data URIs and encodes them for cross-browser support,
- [svg-fill-loader](https://github.com/kisenka/svg-fill-loader) allows specifying a fill colour as a query parameter.

If an icon exceeds 1 kB, it is loaded as an external file like other assets (`background-image: url('<localhost-or-cdn>/chevron-right.svg')`. The set-up only applies to SVG icons in the `components/icons/` folder (aliased to `icons/` for convenience) that are referenced from a CSS file with `url('~icons/...')`.


### In Vue components

Components that are meant to become container templates in the CMS don't have markup restrictions and can therefore include inline SVG. To add an icon to such a component, use the `Icon` component (registered globally for convenience). The icon must be present in the sprite file, `components/icons/sprite.svg`.

```html
<!-- USAGE -->
<icon name="chevron-right" />

<!-- OUTPUT (IN DEV) -->
<svg role="presentation" focusable="false">
  <use xlink:href="/sprite.svg#chevron-right" />
</svg>

<!-- OUTPUT (IN PROD) -->
<svg role="presentation" focusable="false">
  <use xlink:href="https://d2glwx35mhbfwf.cloudfront.net/<version>/sprite.svg#chevron-right" />
</svg>

<!-- WITH PROPS -->
<icon class="my-component__icon" name="chevron-right" width="24" height="24" />
```

Many browsers have issues dealing with responsive SVGs (e.g. `width: 100%;`). For icons especially, it is better for the `svg` element to have a fixed width and height. You can do this by passing a `width` and `height` to the `Icon` component, but CSS is more practical as you can use relative units and resize the icon at different breakpoints.

```html
<icon class="my-component__icon" name="chevron-right"  />
```

```css
.my-component__icon {
  width: 1.5em;
  height: 1.5em;
}
```

#### Under the hood

Webpack loads the sprite file like a normal asset. In production, `file-loader` automatically prefixes its path with the URL of the CDN (cf. `output.publicPath`).


## How to use icons in the CMS

- Some icons, like button chevrons, just work and don't require any extra classes or markup.
- Icons used in container templates are to be inlined in the markup just as they appear in the documentation -- i.e.
    ```html
    <svg ...>
      <use xlink:href="https://d2glwx35mhbfwf.cloudfront.net/<version>/sprite.js#<icon-name>" />
    </svg>
    ```
