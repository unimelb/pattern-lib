# pre-push hook for git
# updates the pre-release version number before pushing
# This will only have any effect when pushing to the dev (or $protected) branch
# Its purpose is to jig the version number to prompt remote build (currently via Semaphore)
# Expected behaviour:
# on clean dev branch
# git push (1st time)
# - update SemVer version number
# - make a commit (but don't push)
# git push (2nd time)
# - pushes single commit only if it relates to a version change
# to install it:
# cp ./pre-push.sh .git/hooks/pre-push
# requires
#   jq, available on homebrew and elsewhere
#   sponge (from moreutils), available from homebrew and elsewhere
#   the semver node module
